\section*{Variance and Covariance}
\begin{problem}
Let $X$ and~$Y$ be two independent random variables.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that the independence of~$X$ and~$Y$ implies that their
covariance is zero.

\item Zero covariance \textit{does not} imply independence between two
      random variables. Give an example of this.

\item For a scalar constant~$a$, show the following two properties:
\begin{align*}
  \E(X + aY) &= \E(X) + a\E(Y)\\
  \var(X + aY) &= \var(X) + a^2\var(Y)
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\noindent\textbf{Solution}

\noindent\textbf{(a)} \textit{Proof:}
\begin{align*}
cov(X,Y) &= \mathbb{E}((X-\mathbb{E}(X)(Y-\mathbb{E}(Y))\\
&= \mathbb{E}(XY-X\mathbb{E}(Y)-Y\mathbb{E}(X)+\mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y))\\
&= \mathbb{E}(XY)-\mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y)\\
&= \mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y) - \mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y) \quad \text{since $\mathbb{E}(XY) = \mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y)$ when $X,Y$ are independent}\\
&= 0
\end{align*}\qed

\medskip

\noindent \textbf{(b)} Let $X=Z, Y=Z^2,$ and $\mathbb{E}(Z) = 0 = \mathbb{E}(Z^3)$. Then
\begin{align*}
cov(X,Y) &= \mathbb{E}(z\cdot z^2)- \mathbb{E}(z)\mathbb{E}(z^2)\\
&=\mathbb{E}(Z^3) - \mathbb{E}(z)\mathbb{E}(z^2)\\
&= 0
\end{align*}

but $X,Y$ are not at all independent-- indeed, they're highly dependent.\qed

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{(c)} \textit{Proof:}
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(X+aY) &= \sum_x \sum_y (x+ay)P(X=x,Y=y)\\
&=\sum_x \sum_y xP(X=x,Y=y) + \sum_x\sum_y ayP(X=x,Y=y)\\
&= \sum_x\sum_y xP(X=x,Y=y)+\sum_y\sum_x ayP(X=x,Y=y)\\ &\qquad \text{ just switching the order of sums in the second term}\\
&= \sum_x x \sum_y P(X=x,Y=y)+a\sum_y y\sum_x P(X=x,Y=y)\\ &\qquad \text{ to reflect correct variables being summed over, and since $a$ is a constant}\\
&= \sum_x xP(X=x) + a\sum_y yP(Y=y)\\
&= \mathbb{E}(X) + a\mathbb{E}(Y)
\end{align*}\qed

\medskip

\begin{align*}
\var(X+aY) &= \mathbb{E}(((X+aY)-\mathbb{E}(X+aY))^2)\\
&=\mathbb{E}(((X+aY)-(\mathbb{E}(X) + a\mathbb{E}(Y)))^2) \quad \text{by linearity of expectations (above)}\\
&= \mathbb{E}(((X-\mathbb{E}(X))+a(Y-\mathbb{E}(Y)))^2)\\
&= \mathbb{E}((X-\mathbb{E}X)^2 + 2a(X-\mathbb{E}X)(Y-\mathbb{E}Y) + a^2(Y-\mathbb{E}Y)^2) \\
&\qquad \text{ where I've at this point switched notation such that $\mathbb{E}Z = \mathbb{E}(Z)$, since the brackets}\\
&\qquad \text{ are getting confusingly messy}\\
&= \mathbb{E}(X-\mathbb{E}X)^2+ 2a\mathbb{E}(X-\mathbb{E}X)(Y-\mathbb{E}Y) + a^2\mathbb{E}(Y-\mathbb{E}Y)^2 \quad \text{by linearity}\\
&= \mathbb{E}(X-\mathbb{E}X)^2+ a^2\mathbb{E}(Y-\mathbb{E}Y)^2 \\
&\qquad \text{since the middle term is the covariance, which is 0 for $X,Y$ independent}\\
&= \var(X)+a^2\var(Y)
\end{align*}\qed

\section*{Densities}
\begin{problem}
Answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Can a probability density function (pdf) ever take values greater than 1?
  \item Let $X$ be a univariate normally distributed random variable with mean 0
        and variance $1/100$. What is the pdf of $X$?
  \item What is the value of this pdf at 0?
  \item What is the probability that $X = 0$?
  \item Explain the discrepancy.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\noindent\textbf{Solution}

\noindent\textbf{(a)} Yes, as long as it still integrates to 1. For example, take the uniform distribution on the interval $[0,a]$ for $a < 1$. Then in order for the total probability to equal 1, we must have that the pdf $f(x) = \frac{1}{a} >1$ over the interval $[0,a]$ (and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise).

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{(b)} Let $f(x)$ be the pdf of $X$. Then 
\begin{align*}
 X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\frac{1}{100}) \implies f(x) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\cdot\frac{1}{100}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-0)^2}{2\cdot\frac{1}{100}}\right)\\
 &= \sqrt{\frac{50}{\pi}} \exp(-50x^2)
\end{align*}

\noindent\textbf{(c)} $$f(0) = \sqrt{\frac{50}{x}}$$

\noindent \textbf{(d)} $$P(X=0) = 0$$

\noindent\textbf{(e)} In short, a probability \textit{density} is not the same as a probability. Since a PDF is defined over a continuous (in particular, uncountably infinite) interval, the probability that it will take on any particular value is 0 (consider that if not, then we would sum an uncountably infinite number of positive values, which would certainly not have sum equal to 1, as is required of a probability distribution). Only intervals of positive length have nonzero probability. This is why in part (a), we have that a pdf can take values greater than 1, despite probabilities themselves being unable to have values greater than 1.

\section*{Conditioning and Bayes' rule}
\begin{problem}
  Let $\v \mu \in \R^m$ and
  $\v \Sigma, \v \Sigma' \in \R^{m \times m}$.  Let $X$ be an
  $m$-dimensional random vector with
  $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\v \mu, \v \Sigma)$, and let $Y$ be a
  $m$-dimensional random vector such that
  $Y \given X \sim \mathcal{N}(X, \v \Sigma')$. Derive the
  distribution and parameters for each of the following.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item The unconditional distribution of $Y$.

  \item The joint distribution for the pair $(X,Y)$.

\end{enumerate}

Hints:
\begin{itemize}
\item You may use without proof (but they are good advanced exercises)
  the closure properties of multivariate normal distributions. Why is
  it helpful to know when a distribution is normal?
\item Review Eve's and Adam's Laws, linearity properties of
  expectation and variance, and Law of Total Covariance.

\end{itemize}

        \item Suppose $\v X$ is square (i.e., $n=m$) and symmetric.
              What does this tell you about the eigenvalues of $\v X$?
              What are the eigenvalues of $\v X + \v I$, where $\v I$ is the identity matrix?
        \item Suppose $\v X$ is square, symmetric, and invertible.

		\item Make use of singular value decomposition and the properties
			  of orthogonal matrices. Show your work.
		\item Review and make use of (but do not derive) the spectral theorem.
	\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\noindent\textbf{Solution}

\noindent\textbf{(a)} Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $\mathbf{XX^\top}$, with eigenvalue $\lambda \neq 0$. Then

\mathbf{XX^\top} &= \lambda\mathbf{v}\\
\implies

\section*{Vector Calculus}
\begin{problem}
  Let $\v x, \v y \in \R^m$ and $\v A \in \R^{m \times m}$. Please derive from
  elementary scalar calculus the following useful properties. Write
  your final answers in vector notation.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item What is the gradient with respect to $\v x$ of $\v x^T \v y$?
    \item What is the gradient with respect to $\v x$ of $\v x^T \v x$?
    \item What is the gradient with respect to $\v x$ of $\v x^T \v A \v x$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\noindent\textbf{Solution}

\noindent\textbf{(a)} Let $f = \v x^\top \v y = x_1y_1+...+x_my_m$. Then
\begin{align*}
\nabla_{\v x} f &= (\partial_{x_1}f, ..., \partial_{x_m}f)\\
&= (y_1, ..., y_m)\\
&= \v y
\end{align*}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{(b)} Let $g = \v x^\top \v x = x_1x_1+...+x_mx_m = x_1^2+...+x_m^2$. Then
\begin{align*}
\nabla_{\v x} g &= (\partial_{x_1}g, ..., \partial_{x_m}g)\\
&= (2x_1, ..., 2x_m)\\
&= 2\cdot (x_1,...,x_m)\\
&= 2\v x
\end{align*}

\bigskip

\begin{comment}
%\v x^\top 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \sum_{i=1}^m A_{1i}x_i  \\
     \sum_{i=1}^m A_{2i}x_i \\
    \vdots \\
     \sum_{i=1}^m A_{mi}x_i
\end{bmatrix}\\
\end{comment}

\noindent\textbf{(c)} Let 
$h = \v x^\top \v A \v x =\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^m x_iA_{ij}x_j$.
 Then
\begin{align*}
\nabla_{\v x} h &= (\partial_{x_1}h, ..., \partial_{x_m}h)\\
&= (\sum_{i=1}^m A_{i1}x_i + \sum_{j=1}^m A_{1j}x_j, ..., \sum_{i=1}^m A_{im}x_i + \sum_{j=1}^m A_{mj}x_j)\\
&= (\sum_{i=1}^m (A_{i1}+A_{1i})x_i ,..., \sum_{i=1}^m (A_{im}+A_{mi}))x_i \qquad \text{ just by reindexing $j$'s with $i$'s}\\
&= (\v A + \v A^\top) \v x
\end{align*}
And thus if $\v A$ is symmetric, $$\nabla_{\v x} h = 2\v A\v x.$$

\section*{Gradient Check}
\begin{problem}
  Often after finishing an analytic derivation of a gradient, you will
  need to implement it in code.  However, there may be mistakes -
  either in the derivation or in the implementation. This is
  particularly the case for gradients of multivariate functions.

  \air

  \noindent One way to check your work is to numerically estimate the gradient
  and check it on a variety of inputs. For this problem we consider
  the simplest case of a univariate function and its derivative.  For
  example, consider a function $f(x): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$:
$$\frac{d f}{d x} = \underset{\epsilon \to 0} \lim \frac{f(x + \epsilon) - f(x - \epsilon)}{2 \epsilon}$$
\noindent A common check is to evaluate the right-hand side for a small value of
$\epsilon$, and check that the result is similar to your analytic
result.\\

\smallskip

\noindent In this problem, you will implement the analytic and numerical derivatives of the function \[f(x) = \cos(x) + x^2 + e^x.\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement \texttt{f} in Python (feel free to use whatever \texttt{numpy} or \texttt{scipy} functions you need):
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
  def f(x):

  \end{lstlisting}
  \item Analytically derive the derivative of that function, and implement it in Python:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
  def grad_f(x):

  \end{lstlisting}
  \item Now, implement a gradient check (the numerical approximation to the derivative), and by plotting, 
        show that the numerical approximation approaches the analytic as \texttt{epsilon} 
        $\to 0$ for a few values of $x$:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
  def grad_check(x, epsilon):

  \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\noindent\textbf{Solution}

\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
\end{verbatim}


\noindent\textbf{1.} \begin{verbatim}
def f(x):
    return np.cos(x) + x**2 + np.exp(x)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\textbf{2.} \begin{verbatim}
def grad_f(x):
    return -np.sin(x) + 2*x + np.exp(x)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent\textbf{3.} \begin{verbatim}
def grad_check(x, epsilon):
    return (f(x + epsilon) - f(x - epsilon))/2*epsilon
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The plot below shows the values of the analytical gradient of $f(x)$ as compared with the numerical approximation, for $x \in [0,1]$ at 0.001 increments. 

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig1}

\noindent The \textcolor{blue}{blue} line is the approximation at $\epsilon = 1.0$.

\noindent The \textcolor{red}{red} line is the approximation at $\epsilon = 0.5$.

\noindent The \textcolor{purple}{purple-ish} line is actually four lines: the approximations at $\epsilon = 0.1$, at $\epsilon = 0.01$, and at $\epsilon = 0.001$, as well as the analytically computed gradient. However, as can be seen clearly, the approximations converse sufficiently quickly that we cannot visually discern between the approximations and the true gradient.
